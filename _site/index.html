While it was intriguing to read about all sorts of burglaries, you have to read through lots of "fluff" to get to the interesting parts—most likely because the author compiled several of their articles into this book.</p> <p><a href="/book/BurglarsGuide">Read my notes</a></p> <hr /> <a href="/book/ScarletLetter"><img src="/images/ScarletLetter.gif" alt="The Scarlet Letter" class="cover" /></a> <h3><a href="/book/ScarletLetter">The Scarlet Letter</a></h3> <h4>by Nathaniel Hawthorne</h4> <p>I last read this on September 21, 2021 and I recommend it <b>7</b>/10.</p> <p>Although I had to read this for school, this was still an enjoyable read. It's considered a classic because of the hidden symbolism that I imagine becomes more apparent each time you read it.</p> <p><a href="/book/ScarletLetter">Read my notes</a></p> </div> </body> </html>
