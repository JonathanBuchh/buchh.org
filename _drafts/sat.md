description: How I Gained 200+ Points to Score in the 99<sup>th</sup> Percentile

When I first started studying for the SAT, I felt lost. I didn't know what books I should be purchasing, which practice tests I should taking, or how much I should be studying. Everyone was trying to sell me something, whether it be their online services or personal tutoring. I thought it would be helpful for me (a high school Junior, not an adult) to document my SAT studying techniques, even if it will helpful for my sister, who will be taking the SAT in the next couple of years (as long as it is still a relevant metric). By no means am I saying my method was perfect or will be the best for you, but it did help me go from a 1290 (85<sup>th</sup> percentile) on my first practice test to the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile on the December 2021 SAT (200+ point gain). I don't say this to gloat, but to add to credibility of this method.

In my mind, there are three layers to the SAT. If you want to score above 1500, you'll need to get to layer 3.

## Layer 1: Understanding the Content

The first thing I did was make sure I knew how to solve every problem. To score above 1500, you need to know how to solve every problem on the test, since your margin of error is slim. I took a practice test and went through each problem individually to make sure I knew how to do it. If I didn't, I would look up a tutorial to (re)learn the material. After this, I did 1,762 practice problems  on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/sat). During this stage, I would recommend doing a practice test on the weekend (minimum of one every other week).

You know you're past layer 1 when you feel stupid every time you get a problem wrong because you know the material and should have responded correctly.

## Layer 2: Knowing the Types of Questions on the SAT

After doing many practice problems, you start to understand the exact types of questions covered on the SAT. You know what answer the College Board wants before you look at the answer choices because you've seen questions that look exactly the same, just with different "variables."

I found meeting with a tutor to be beneficial during this stage—helping me gain 100 points on the math section alone. I met with my tutor three times and thought it was both time and money well spent.

Layer 2 doesn't really apply to the Evidence-Based Reading section because you need to understand the text as well as the questions. I found it to be much less formulaic than the other sections. It's notoriously difficult to improve quickly (you kind of just need to read books to be good at it). Fortunately, I rekindled my love for reading[^1] during "lockdown" in 2020, so the Evidence-Based Reading was my strongest section at first; however it was my weakest section on my December 2021 SAT, since it improved the least of the four sections.

Improvement in layer 2 mainly comes from doing lots of practice tests, though you don't need to do them all at once. I would try to do one section of a practice test each day, scoring it after I finished each section so I could quickly see what I got wrong. I found Khan Academy practice problems for level 1, doing practice tests is far more realistic and subsequently better for level 2.

You know you're past layer 2 when you start reading a question (except for the Evidence-Based Reading section) and already know what College Board wants you to answer (make sure not to rush to the wrong conclusion!).

## Layer 3: Slowing Down

I only got to layer 3 a week or two before I took the SAT in December of 2021. When I first started taking practice tests, I would barely finish every question on time. After enough practice, I started to gain more and more time to check my work after each section until eventually, I had time to check every question, which is what I define as layer 3.

## Which Book?

I bought the book my tutor recommended, but didn't find it to be too helpful. In my opinion and experience, they are overwhelming, since they are too long to complete in full, aren't great at explaining forgotten concepts, and probably a waste of money. Outside of completing a few assigned problems from my tutor, I only used my book to do extra practice tests after I ran out of the tests provided by College Board.

## SAT Tutors

My SAT tutor provided phenomenal value. She helped me understand that I should never feel ambivalent to

She helped me solve math problems in new, faster ways that I didn't learn in school. I met with her three times and found our time together was best used when she (1) taught me faster ways to solve math problems and (2) pointed out the types of questions people often got wrong or could be solved.

## SAT Prep Courses

While I didn't find a need to take an SAT prep course myself, it could be a good option for some people. If you aren't able to self-discipline, an SAT prep course is probably a good option. Because you are spending thousands of dollars, you could feel pressure to make the most of you time. I'd try practicing at home first before committing to an SAT prep course.

## Appendix

Good luck on your SAT!

<!--

- Look at CollegeBoard study
- Watch
- Do FRQ first
- Outside help helps you step outside of yourself and see how you can solve a problem in a new way. Also good for diagnosing what you need to work on
- Expensive class if you aren't able to study on your own
- I'm writing this both for my sister and what I wanted for myself
- Plug in answers
- Start reading early—hardest to change
- Know that there is one most correct answer
- Books might not be so helpful
- Three levels of preparation for math:
    1. Understand content (feel stupid when you get a problem wrong)
    2. Know which types of problems to expect
    3. Finish with lots of time to spare
- Writing tips:
    - Try each answer yourself.
    - Learn what they're asking for. For example, I could immediately tell when they wanted me to make sure verb tense was correct or when they wanted me to match commas or when they wanted me to pick the most specific descriptor or when they wanted me to choose the most concise answer
- Reading tips:
    - Read the title and description—they're there for a reason
    - I found that writing notes to myself helped
- Know about the experimental section
- Do test on paper for many reasons:
    - It's more realistic. When on the computer, it's easier to reference the text because you don't have to flip pages and you're tempted to search for a certain word or passage, which you can't do with your eyes in the real thing.
    - You can print out PDFs
    - It helps with math to write on the problem. Also gets you used to the amount of scratch paper
- Use a watch
- Know that the College Board will charge you more money after you get your score, so plan to take it every two months, know that you will pay more, or schedule ahead.
- Math score increased 100 points with external help
