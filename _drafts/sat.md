## Why

I'm writing this guide for my past self as well as my sister. This isn't to

I am not writing this to show how good of a job I did, but to write down what worked for me and what I would have done differently for my past self.

Here's a big picture timeline of what you should do:

On completion of Algebra I, you should take a practice SAT. While taking an entire practice test is ideal, it's fine to just take the math section. The point of taking a practice SAT this early is twofold: (1) you already know how to do a lot of the test and (2) it will help you learn what you should especially pay attention to in class.

- Look at CollegeBoard study
- Watch
- Do FRQ first
- Outside help helps you step outside of yourself and see how you can solve a problem in a new way. Also good for diagnosing what you need to work on
- Expensive class if you aren't able to study on your own
- I'm writing this both for my sister and what I wanted for myself
- Plug in answers
- Start reading early—hardest to change
- Know that there is one most correct answer
- Books might not be so helpful
- Three levels of preparation for math:
    1. Understand content (feel stupid when you get a problem wrong)
    2. Know which types of problems to expect
    3. Finish with lots of time to spare
- Writing tips:
    - Try each answer yourself.
    - Learn what they're asking for. For example, I could immediately tell when they wanted me to make sure verb tense was correct or when they wanted me to match commas or when they wanted me to pick the most specific descriptor or when they wanted me to choose the most concise answer
- Reading tips:
    - Read the title and description—they're there for a reason
    - I found that writing notes to myself helped
- Know about the experimental section
- Do test on paper for many reasons:
    - It's more realistic. When on the computer, it's easier to reference the text because you don't have to flip pages and you're tempted to search for a certain word or passage, which you can't do with your eyes in the real thing.
    - You can print out PDFs
    - It helps with math to write on the problem. Also gets you used to the amount of scratch paper
- Use a watch
- Know that the College Board will charge you more money after you get your score, so plan to take it every two months, know that you will pay more, or schedule ahead.
- Math score increased 100 points with external help
