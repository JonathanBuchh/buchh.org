<small><b>May 7, 2022</b></small></h1><p>This is the letter I submitted to The New York Times&rsquo; <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/opinion/letters/high-school-letters-competition.html>student letter writing
competition</a>. Although my letter was <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/07/opinion/letters/high-school-student-letters.html>not selected</a>, I still like what I wrote
and am publishing it here<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. It is a response to an opinion piece titled:
<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/opinion/why-we-admire-zelensky.html>Why We Admire Zelensky</a>.</p><p><strong>To the Editor:</strong></p><p>I cannot stop from wondering, &ldquo;Is this real life?&rdquo; After watching the first
episode of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People_(TV_series)>Servant of the People</a>, both the name of Zelensky&rsquo;s political party
and TV show he starred as president, my eyes were opened to the striking
similarities between the show and reality. His character and he were elected
for the same reason: &ldquo;to bring professional, decent people to power.&rdquo; As an
outsider, Zelensky&rsquo;s story sounds like a fairytale, but it is not. This is real
life.</p><p>As I, along with the rest of the world, hold my breath as we watch Russia&rsquo;s
invasion of Ukraine unfold, I have trouble accepting real life. My generation
does not know what to expect. We are the oldest alive to have never experienced
widespread global conflict. We did not live through the Cold War like my
parents; we never grew up during World War II like my grandparents; and we never
saw the end of World War I like my great grandparents. We fear what might happen
with more direct foreign involvement in this conflict. Despite the imminent
threat of death, Zelensky and the Ukrainians&rsquo; resilience gives me hope that
democracy and freedom can prevail.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>One of the many benefits of having your own website :)&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></main><hr><footer><small>Made with â™¡ for the open web by <a href=https://twitter.com/JonathanBuchh>@JonathanBuchh</a>.</small></footer></body></html>
