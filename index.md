I'm a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School chasing the Lord. I am also fond of:
- Books
- Khan Academy
- Rowing
- Social justice

## Writing

I just started writing online. Here are my recent posts:

<div class="posts">
<h3>Title</h3>
<h3>Date</h3>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <div>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
  </div>
  <time>{{ post.date | date: "%b %d, %Y" }}</time>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
