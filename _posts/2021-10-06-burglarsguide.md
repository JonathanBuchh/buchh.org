I picked this up because it was a "Staff Favorite" at a famous book store in New York City. While it was intriguing to read about all sorts of burglaries, you have to read through "fluff" to get to the interesting partsâ€”likely because the author compiled several of their articles into this book.

## Notes

Burglars use the world around us differently because they have a different objective.

We only know about the ways burglars think based on the ones that we've caught. The practices of the "best" burglar's work are largely unknown because they escaped (selection bias).
