This book was riddled with grammatical, spelling, and syntax errors, but was filled with great information. It seems like the publisher wanted Mulligan to use Markdown, but he didn't really understand it. Here's an excerpt where the author tries to italicize "immediately," but puts an underscore one space too early:

> you should_ immediately_ begin

I wanted to publish my notes here, but it seems like a copyright infringement because this book is different from most other books I read in that it has a lot more "specifics" than "big ideas." You buy this book for the tips and workouts, not to learn about novel new ideas, so it feels unethical for be to put those things on the internet and take buyers away from Mulligan. That being said, you probably shouldn't buy this book unless you have rowed before, are serious about erging, and don't have much prior knowledge about 2k preparation. If you have rowed above the high school level, you most likely already know everything that will be covered in the book.
