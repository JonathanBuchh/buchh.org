I had higher expectations for this book.
It could be that I was already familiar with many of the arguments &lt;em>Mere Christianity&lt;/em> introduces (likely from people who read this book themselves) or that I didn&amp;rsquo;t approach reading it with historical significance in mind.
I imagine that I might revisit this book at later date—when I can appreciate it better.
It was difficult for me to get past Lewis&amp;rsquo; personal opinion in some sections and appreciate the larger picture of the arguments he made.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/mere-christianity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/mere-christianity/</guid></item><item><title>Angela's Ashes</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/angelas-ashes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/angelas-ashes/</guid></item><item><title>One Writer's Beginnings</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/one-writers-beginnings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/one-writers-beginnings/</guid></item><item><title>From Paycheck to Purpose</title><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a Dave Ramsey kick recently and have heard Ken Coleman co-host on The Ramsey Show several times, so I thought I would give this book a shot—even though I am far from the target audience.
Like the other books from Ramsey Solutions that I&amp;rsquo;ve read, the writing quality is poor and could be consolidated to a couple of articles.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that most supporting arguments came from anecdotal evidence.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/from-paycheck-to-purpose/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/from-paycheck-to-purpose/</guid></item><item><title>Die With Zero</title><description>&lt;p>I read this book just after being introduced to &lt;a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s 7 Baby Steps&lt;/a>, which for their obvious flaws, have helped many people climb out of debt.
&lt;em>Die With Zero&lt;/em> is written for people who already know that they should live below their means and save for retirement—an audience that does not overlap with Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s.
Bill Perkins writes to people who are likely to &lt;em>oversave&lt;/em> for retirement, and asks readers to consider a different way of looking at money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of maximizing your life for the largest retirement savings account, Perkins suggests living a life where &lt;em>life enjoyment&lt;/em> is optimized.
He doesn&amp;rsquo;t suggest spending lavishly, but he does put an emphasis on using your money intentionally.
Money is only useful for what it can buy and because it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to delay present enjoyment for a greater reward later, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to miss out on enjoyment in the process.
Money is only worth what it can buy you.
It&amp;rsquo;s worthless on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Die With Zero&lt;/em> mindset considers investment in human capital and unquantifiable returns in addition to typical investments.
A trip to Europe is a great example.
Timing is critical.
You could do this trip while in your 20&amp;rsquo;s with little savings, or wait until your 30&amp;rsquo;s when you have a little more in the bank.
Sure, saving aggressively when you&amp;rsquo;re young is important.
Compound interest rewards you well.
But waiting too long to take the trip to Europe, might leave you feeling too old to stay in a hostel or you could now have kids that make taking a month-long trip away from them feel foolish.
And this doesn&amp;rsquo;t even consider the impact of a changed worldview from the trip.
You can&amp;rsquo;t put a number that.
Moreover, who&amp;rsquo;s to say you&amp;rsquo;ll even benefit from the difference in savings by delaying the trip.
You might be unable to use the money you saved so diligently because you are physically incapable of doing some of the things you always dreamed of doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book helped me reevaluate the way I look at spending and saving.
Dying with no money in the bank is an impossible task because no one knows when they will die, but Perkins says you can try to get close.
Dying with no money in the bank seems selfish at first because it sounds like you are leaving no inheritance and give nothing to charity.
Perkins just means that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to die with money in the bank that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a purpose.
He intentionally sets aside money to be donated and for his kids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perkins also wants to give most of his kids&amp;rsquo; inheritance to them while he is alive.
He could put an amount aside now and let compound interest do its magic, but the longer he waits to give his kids their inheritance, the less utility of the money.
Less money given to a 25-year-old can have a much bigger impact than more given to a 50-year-old.
Most people already own a home at age 50 and they probably already have everything they need, but at age 25, someone might be looking to put a downpayment on a house for the first time.
Perkins wants to use his inheritance where the value of the money given is greater than its face value, like in this situation.
Receiving money would greatly accelerate the process of saving for a downpayment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, trying to die with no money in the bank when I die is far too extreme for me, but the thought experiments in this book have changed the way I see money forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I fully recommend this book.
Please read it.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/die-with-zero/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/die-with-zero/</guid></item><item><title>The Total Money Makeover</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-total-money-makeover/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-total-money-makeover/</guid></item><item><title>Baby Steps Millionaires</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/baby-steps-millionaires/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/baby-steps-millionaires/</guid></item><item><title>Why I Am Not Going to Buy a Computer</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/why-i-am-not-going-to-buy-a-computer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/why-i-am-not-going-to-buy-a-computer/</guid></item><item><title>Slaughterhouse-Five</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/kurt-vonnegut/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/kurt-vonnegut/</guid></item><item><title>The Fault in Our Stars</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-fault-in-our-stars/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-fault-in-our-stars/</guid></item><item><title>Crying in H Mart</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/crying-in-h-mart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/crying-in-h-mart/</guid></item><item><title>This Is Water</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/this-is-water/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/this-is-water/</guid></item><item><title>Between Two Kingdoms</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/between-two-kingdoms/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/between-two-kingdoms/</guid></item><item><title>Excellent Sheep</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/excellent-sheep/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/excellent-sheep/</guid></item><item><title>Re: Why We Admire Zelensky</title><description>&lt;p>This is the letter I submitted to The New York Times&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/opinion/letters/high-school-letters-competition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">student letter writing

&lt;p>&lt;strong>To the Editor:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cannot stop from wondering, &amp;ldquo;Is this real life?&amp;rdquo; After watching the first
episode of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_of_the_People_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Servant of the People&lt;/a>, both the name of Zelensky&amp;rsquo;s political party
and TV show he starred as president, my eyes were opened to the striking
similarities between the show and reality. His character and he were elected
for the same reason: &amp;ldquo;to bring professional, decent people to power.&amp;rdquo; As an
outsider, Zelensky&amp;rsquo;s story sounds like a fairytale, but it is not. This is real
life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I, along with the rest of the world, hold my breath as we watch Russia&amp;rsquo;s
invasion of Ukraine unfold, I have trouble accepting real life. My generation
does not know what to expect. We are the oldest alive to have never experienced
widespread global conflict. We did not live through the Cold War like my
parents; we never grew up during World War II like my grandparents; and we never
saw the end of World War I like my great grandparents. We fear what might happen
with more direct foreign involvement in this conflict. Despite the imminent
threat of death, Zelensky and the Ukrainians&amp;rsquo; resilience gives me hope that
democracy and freedom can prevail.&lt;/p>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what books
I should be purchasing, which practice tests I should taking, or how much I
should be studying. I thought it would be helpful for me (a high school Junior)
to document my SAT studying techniques—even if it will only be helpful for my
sister, who will be taking the SAT in the next couple of years (as long as it is
still a relevant metric). By no means am I saying my method will work for you or
that it is the best way to study for the SAT, but it could be of use to some,
since it helped me gain 250+ points from my first practice test in August 2021
(85&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> percentile) to the December 2021 SAT (99&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup>
percentile). I don&amp;rsquo;t say this to gloat, but to add credibility to this approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my mind, there are three stages to studying for the SAT. If you want to score
above 1500, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get to stage 3, since your margin of error is slim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of note, it&amp;rsquo;s notoriously difficult to improve the Evidence-Based Reading
section. You really just need to read actual books to do well, though the
methodology described below can help—just to a lesser extent than the other
three sections. I rekindled my love for reading&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> during &amp;ldquo;lockdown&amp;rdquo;
in 2020, so the Evidence-Based Reading started out as my strongest section;
however, it turned out to be my weakest section on my December 2021 SAT, since
my score in that section improved the least.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="stage-1-understanding-the-content">Stage 1: Understanding the Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first thing I did was make sure I knew how to solve every problem. It&amp;rsquo;s hard
to practice when you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to get the right answer. Initially, I took a
practice test and then went through each problem individually, marking each
answer as correct or incorrect. On incorrectly marked questions, I checked to
see if I knew how to get the correct answer. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t, I would (re)learn the
material by watching videos I found on the internet&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. After this, I
grinded out 1,762 free practice problems on &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/sat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khan Academy&lt;/a>. During this stage, I
would recommend doing a full practice test&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> on the weekends (at
least one every other week, though once a week is better). Completing practice
tests in full improves your concentration and allows you to become more familiar
with the testing format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know you&amp;rsquo;re past stage 1 when you feel stupid every time you get a problem
wrong because you know why the right answer is right.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sat-books">SAT Books&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I bought the book my tutor recommended (more on tutors below), but didn&amp;rsquo;t find
it to be too helpful. It is possible that I could have gained more from my SAT
book had I spent more time with it. My book—like most, if not all SAT books—was
so long that I was honestly overwhelmed by it. Outside of completing a few
assigned problems from my tutor, I only used my book to do extra practice tests
after I ran out of the tests provided for free by College Board. I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to
believe that purchasing an SAT book is not necessary, but by all means, buy the
one that someone you trust recommends. Maybe it will be exactly what you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sat-prep-courses">SAT Prep Courses&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While I didn&amp;rsquo;t take an SAT prep course, I think it could be a great option for
some people. If you have trouble with self-discipline and focus, an SAT prep
course would probably be helpful. If practicing on your own isn&amp;rsquo;t difficult, the
cost of an SAT prep course likely does not justify its high price tag.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="stage-2-familiarity-with-the-test-format">Stage 2: Familiarity With the Test Format&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After doing many practice problems, I noticed patterns in the types of questions
covered on the SAT. Upon seeing a question, I immediately knew the type of
answer choices that would be available since I had done many similar practice
problems, just with different &amp;ldquo;variables.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Improvement in stage 2 mainly comes from doing lots of practice tests. You don&amp;rsquo;t
need to set aside 3 hours to complete a full practice test to improve in stage
2. Instead, do one section of a practice test each day. I&amp;rsquo;d still recommend
doing a full practice test on the weekend. Khan Academy is great for stage 1,
when you need to practice several of a certain type of problem to ensure you
really know how to do it. However, in stage 2, when you know the material, doing
a practice section is more helpful. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to be able to solve a problem
having done 5 very similar ones in a row; it&amp;rsquo;s a very different thing to get the
question right in the format of an actual SAT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You know you&amp;rsquo;re past stage 2 when you start reading a question and already know
what College Board wants you to answer (make sure not to rush to the wrong
conclusion!).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sat-tutors">SAT Tutors&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I found meeting with a tutor to be beneficial during stage 2. I met with my
tutor three times (1 hour each time, totaling to 3 hours) and saw an increase of
~100 points on practice math sections. It was definitely time and money well
spent. If you can, try learning new material on your own, instead of with a
tutor, since your time with a tutor can be better spent elsewhere. My tutor
showed how to avoid common mistakes, taught me that I should never feel
ambivalent about any two answers, since there will only be one &lt;em>best&lt;/em> answer,
and gave me tips to better take advantage of the format of the SAT. I also
learned how to solve math problems in new, faster ways that weren&amp;rsquo;t taught to me
in school. These tips were not obvious to me on my own, but were extremely
beneficial in helping me improve my SAT score.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="stage-3-pacing">Stage 3: Pacing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I got to stage 3 just a week or two before I took the December 2021 SAT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first started taking practice tests, I could barely finish a section on
time, but after enough practice, I had enough time to partially check my work a
second time. At this point, I needed to pace myself and slow down. I found I
scored better when I took my time when first answering questions, having just
enough time to thoroughly check my work once than when I rushed through the test
and had time to check my work twice. It was hard to convince myself to
meticulously examine my work after having already done it once. To score in the
1500s, it is critical to check your work, since you can&amp;rsquo;t miss many questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you get to the point where you need to slow down, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much else you
can do to improve besides calming nerves and gaining confidence by doing well on
additional practice tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="timing">Timing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I highly recommend taking the SAT in August of the start of your junior year.
Because you have plenty of time before you need to submit an SAT score, you can
use the August SAT as a super low pressure environment to understand what it
feels like to take an SAT. Because this test date is several months earlier than
the PSAT, the &lt;em>only&lt;/em> opportunity to be selected as a National Merit Finalist, it
may not be optimal to peak in August. Instead, try to peak when your school
takes the PSAT and schedule an SAT close to that date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The worst case scenario is really not that bad: you realize you need to study
more, but at least you&amp;rsquo;ll be more prepared for your next test and for the PSAT,
since you&amp;rsquo;re now more comfortable with the testing environment. The best case
scenario is quite good: you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about the SAT anymore, since
you&amp;rsquo;re happy with your score. Either way, there&amp;rsquo;s a positive outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also found it helpful to bring an analog watch with me to take the SAT.
College Board doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for any watches that make noise (basically all
digital watches) or external timing devices&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, so an analog watch is
the only way to mange your time besides hoping there will be a visible clock.
Not only did I have peace of mind knowing that I would certainly be able to keep
track of time by bringing an analog watch, but I was able to use the watch as a
countdown timer by setting it to count down to 12:00 for each section. For
example, if a section was 25 minutes long, I would set the watch for 11:35 (make
sure to count by 5&amp;rsquo;s so you don&amp;rsquo;t make a silly mistake and think you have
more/less time than you actually have).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="closing">Closing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Good luck on your SAT! If you made it this far, you care enough about your SAT
that I know you&amp;rsquo;ll study hard and do well.&lt;/p>

America&amp;rsquo;s infatuation with football. You might not think these characteristics
describe someone who has played fantasy football for the past several years who
has found success, playing in two championship games last year, but it&amp;rsquo;s true of
me. A lack of passion for &lt;em>American&lt;/em> football has never stopped me from falling
in love with &lt;em>fantasy&lt;/em> football. I love drafting players, managing my (albeit
fake) teams, and pretending I played a part when one of my players has a big
game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is intended to be a beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide to fantasy football, something a new
manager can read so they aren&amp;rsquo;t embarrassed/taken advantage by their coworkers,
family, or friends when added to their first fantasy football league. This guide
includes the basic principles that I have been using to successfully play
fantasy football.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I assume some general knowledge about American football and fantasy football,
such as positions and fantasy football scoring, but nothing that the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_%28gridiron%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fantasy
football Wikipedia
page&lt;/a> can&amp;rsquo;t provide.
At a basic level, you assume the role of the General Manager of a National
Football League (NFL) team, comprised of NFL players from different teams. You
draft a team, pick starting lineups, and earn points based on each player&amp;rsquo;s
performance, competing against other teams in your league.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="drafting">Drafting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The draft is one of the most important parts of fantasy football, but that
doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you need to spend hours researching or making a complex plan to
have a good draft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When making picks, it is paramount to evaluate a player&amp;rsquo;s value compared to
other players you could draft. The easiest way to do this is to compare a given
player&amp;rsquo;s Average Draft Position (ADP) to the current pick. If a player has an
ADP of 56, it means on average, they are selected with the 56th pick. If you
have the 2nd pick, you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t pick a player with an ADP of 56
without good reason, since there should be more valuable players available. The
player with an ADP of 56 should be available in later rounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should be able see each player&amp;rsquo;s ADP while drafting, but rankings can easily
be found online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ADP is just a good rule of thumb to estimate a player&amp;rsquo;s value. If you think it
should be different than ADP, use your own judgment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few common mistakes that beginner fantasy football managers make.
The first is picking a quarterback too early. If you pick for value using ADP,
you won&amp;rsquo;t run into this problem. Additionally, if your league has defenses
and/or kickers, many new players try to go for the best kicker or best defense.
These positions don&amp;rsquo;t really make a difference in the outcome of fantasy games,
so don&amp;rsquo;t pick either of them outside of the last two rounds. These positions are
easily replaceable and aren&amp;rsquo;t very reliable. Another common mistake made by new
managers is picking too many players from their favorite team. While it&amp;rsquo;s fine
to have a few players from your favorite team, if you have too many, when those
players have a bye week, you won&amp;rsquo;t have many players to put in your lineup.
Additionally, if that particular NFL team has a bad week, your fantasy team will
suffer as well. For the same reason you diversify financial assets, you should
diversify your players.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watch mock drafts if you want to see how good drafters think about each pick.
These can be found online.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="in-season">In-season&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you want to win, you need to manage your team. The number one reason that any
fantasy football manager performs poorly is not paying attention to their team.
&amp;ldquo;Managing your team&amp;rdquo; means monitoring updates on your players so that you know
if they&amp;rsquo;ll be playing this week. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to win if you have inactive players
in your starting lineup.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="waiver-wires">Waiver wires&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to get a great player in the later rounds of the draft, more
often than not, you&amp;rsquo;ll be wanting to find replacements for these players.
Luckily, there is something called the waiver wire that allows you to pick up
players that no one else has on their team. Rules on how the waiver wire works
varies from league to league, so ask your commissioner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To pick up someone from the waiver wire, you need to drop someone on your team.
You should do this if they sustain a season ending injury like an ACL tear. You
can also drop a player if they&amp;rsquo;re severely underperforming their expectations
and you can find someone better to add to your team. In both cases, check to see
what fantasy experts say about the player. Sometimes they sustain a minor to
mild injury that might have them out a few games, but are good enough to keep on
your bench. Other times, players just have a bad game. Just because someone
didn&amp;rsquo;t score very many points in your last matchup doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
be on your team. Make sure that fantasy experts agree that a player should be
dropped before you do so yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many fantasy football experts post lists of good waiver wire pickups. You should
read about these players before your waiver wire closes. Every year, there are a
few elite players that show up out of nowhere and are available for free on the
waiver wire. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on the opportunity to get one of these
players for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trades">Trades&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Only trade when necessary. Estimate if you will have a net gain in points if you
make a trade. Some experienced managers like to prey on new mangers and try to
take advantage of them by sending them unbalanced trades. Some leagues have
voting systems that prevent unfair trades from happening, but you need to be
able to determine if a trade is a good deal or not yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="picking-lineups">Picking lineups&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Believe it or not, there is some strategy in making the best lineup. If you are
slated to win, put in players that are consistent. You don&amp;rsquo;t need risky players
that &lt;em>might&lt;/em> score you a lot of points. You need these types of players (often
referred to as &amp;ldquo;boom or bust&amp;rdquo;) when you are supposed to lose by a lot. You can
find out if a player is &amp;ldquo;boom or bust&amp;rdquo; by researching them online.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="appendix">Appendix&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You should now be prepared for a great fantasy season. If your season starts
poorly, don&amp;rsquo;t give up. Even the best fantasy football managers have bad years.
Unexpected things happen. The season is long and a lot changes in between the
start and end of the season.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/ffb/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/ffb/</guid></item><item><title>Catching Fire</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/catching-fire/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/catching-fire/</guid></item><item><title>Deep Work</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/deep-work/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/deep-work/</guid></item><item><title>Mockingjay</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/mockingjay/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/mockingjay/</guid></item><item><title>We Can Be Mended</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/we-can-be-mended/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/we-can-be-mended/</guid></item><item><title>The Hunger Games</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-hunger-games/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-hunger-games/</guid></item><item><title>Allegiant</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/allegiant/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/allegiant/</guid></item><item><title>Insurgent</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/insurgent/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/insurgent/</guid></item><item><title>Divergent</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/divergent/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/divergent/</guid></item><item><title>1984</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/1984/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/1984/</guid></item><item><title>How to Take Smart Notes</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/how-to-take-smart-notes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/how-to-take-smart-notes/</guid></item><item><title>A Tale of Two Cities</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/a-tale-of-two-cities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/a-tale-of-two-cities/</guid></item><item><title>Building a StoryBrand</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/building-a-storybrand/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/building-a-storybrand/</guid></item><item><title>Ivy Study Tips</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/ivy-study-tips/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/ivy-study-tips/</guid></item><item><title>Things Fall Apart</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/things-fall-apart/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/things-fall-apart/</guid></item><item><title>Atomic Habits</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/atomic-habits/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/atomic-habits/</guid></item><item><title>Can't Hurt Me</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/cant-hurt-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/cant-hurt-me/</guid></item><item><title>Think Like a Monk</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/think-like-a-monk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/think-like-a-monk/</guid></item><item><title>The Sports Gene</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-sports-gene/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-sports-gene/</guid></item><item><title>Is God anti-gay?</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/is-god-anti-gay/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/is-god-anti-gay/</guid></item><item><title>Not All of Us Are Saints</title><description>&lt;p>This was particularly interesting to read because David Hilfiker gives insight into the creation of my dad&amp;rsquo;s place of work.

&lt;p>Hilfiker is a great example of what it looks like to commit your life to service.
He noticed a lack of resources for individuals experiencing home insecurity who were too sick to stay in a homeless shelter, but weren&amp;rsquo;t so sick they needed to be in a hospital and created facilities to fill this gap.
Years later, my dad works for Unity Health Care, created out of Health Care for the Homeless Project, which Hilfiker helped start.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/not-all-of-us-are-saints/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/not-all-of-us-are-saints/</guid></item><item><title>Subliminal</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/subliminal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/subliminal/</guid></item><item><title>The Innovators</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-innovators/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-innovators/</guid></item><item><title>The Prodigal God</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-prodigal-god/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-prodigal-god/</guid></item><item><title>Bible</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/bible/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/bible/</guid></item><item><title>Linchpin</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/linchpin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/linchpin/</guid></item><item><title>Dare to Lead</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/</guid></item><item><title>How to Be an Antiracist</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/how-to-be-an-antiracist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/how-to-be-an-antiracist/</guid></item><item><title>The Power of Habit</title><description>&lt;p>I think everyone should read one habit book.

Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because it was dated when I read it.
Regardless, I see work differently than Ferriss.
I want to work a job from which I never want to retire because I believe in its mission.
It also seems myopic to not save for retirement and hope your low-effort money making scheme continues to make ends meet.
In the twelve short years from its release to when I read it, I&amp;rsquo;m not positive that Ferriss&amp;rsquo;s business was still profitable/existed.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-4-hour-workweek/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-4-hour-workweek/</guid></item><item><title>The Tools of Titans</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-tools-of-titans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-tools-of-titans/</guid></item><item><title>Just Mercy</title><description>&lt;p>This book was one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read and the movie doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare.

I can remember feeling so angry at the injustice of people using false testimony to put innocent people on death row.
I thought it was so cool that Bryan Stevenson was his law degree to fight to get wrongly convicted individuals off of death row—pro bono.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/just-mercy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/just-mercy/</guid></item><item><title>Mountains Beyond Mountains</title><description>&lt;p>This book does a great job not only describing Paul Farmer&amp;rsquo;s tenacity to take care of his patients in Haiti, but also how he dealt with the dilemma of prioritizing helping save people&amp;rsquo;s lives over spending time with his family.
In a sense, he saw every moment that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t helping someone in a critical condition to be wasted.
