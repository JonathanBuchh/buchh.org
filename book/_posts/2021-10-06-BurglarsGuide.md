title: A Burglar's Guide to the City
layout: default
review: I picked this up because it was a "Staff Favorite" at a famous book store in New York City. While it was intriguing to read about all sorts of burglaries, this book had lots of "fluff"â€”most likely because the author compiled several of their articles into this book.
