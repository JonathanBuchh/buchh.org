title: A Burglar's Guide to the City
layout: default
review: I picked this up because it was a "Staff Favorite" at a famous book store in New York City. While it was intriguing to read about all sorts of burglaries, this book had lots of "fluff," probably because the author compiled different articles they wrote into this book.
