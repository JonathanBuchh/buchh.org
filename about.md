Hi, I'm Jonathan Buchholz. I'm a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology chasing the Lord.

## Colophon

To make this site fast and lightweight, I use Jekyll. I like scoring 100 in all sections of Google's Lighthouse report. If you're interested, you can browse my [source code](https://github.com/JonathanBuchh/jonathanbuchh.github.io). I use GitHub pages because it's free, easy to maintain, and encourages me to use git.

## Disclaimer

My opinions change over time, so something on this site may not represent my current views. Additionally, I am not an expert in anything, so posts here are just from personal experience and may not have the same result for you.
