It is so different that almost a third of the version that I read was an introduction written by Gregory Hays, which was helpful, though went over my head at times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marcus is focused on controlling what he can and not being controlled by what he cannot. He constantly reminds himself of his own insignificance in &amp;ldquo;the infinite time before&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the equally unbounded time that follows&amp;rdquo; in order to focus on what is important. I believe the following quote to be a microcosm of the way Marcus sees the world. He is expressing gratitude that he had less talent in some areas of his life so he could focus on more pressing endeavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Ultimately, this book is making me consider writing down what &lt;em>I&lt;/em> think is important in the grand scheme of life in a way similar to Marcus.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/meditations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/meditations/</guid></item><item><title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy/</guid></item><item><title>Romans</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/romans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/romans/</guid></item><item><title>Romney</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/romney/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/romney/</guid></item><item><title>Damascus Station</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/damascus-station/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/damascus-station/</guid></item><item><title>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</title><description>&lt;p>What a joy it was to return to a childhood classic.

It remains to be seen if I will read the rest of the trilogy—&lt;em>The Three Body Problem&lt;/em> didn&amp;rsquo;t land on a cliffhanger that is compelling me to find out more; I am satisfied with the ending.&lt;/p>

I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to put down &lt;em>Sweetwater&lt;/em> or its predecessor, &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://buchh.org/reading/depth-charge">Depth Charge&lt;/a>&lt;/em>. Heaton is &lt;a href="https://swimpruf.substack.com/p/paperback-writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unashamedly inspired&lt;/a> by Ian Fleming and thus, his protagonist shares many tropes with James Bond, whether you like them or not. A modern day Fleming, Heaton makes a conscious effort to contemporize his book and adresses themes like mental health, eating disorders, and gender and minorities representation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although Heaton may have initially intended to publish this book through the traditional method, unlike with &lt;em>Depth Charge&lt;/em>, he ended up self-publishing. While I don&amp;rsquo;t know the circumstances, I do know that this book was edited by a literary agent and the Kindle edition is only $2.99!&lt;/p>

I had higher expectations for this book.
It could be that I was already familiar with many of the arguments &lt;em>Mere Christianity&lt;/em> introduces (likely from people who read this book themselves) or that I didn&amp;rsquo;t approach reading it with historical significance in mind.
I imagine that I might revisit this book at later date—when I can appreciate it better.
It was difficult for me to get past Lewis&amp;rsquo; personal opinion in some sections and appreciate the larger picture of the arguments he made.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/mere-christianity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/mere-christianity/</guid></item><item><title>Angela's Ashes</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/angelas-ashes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/angelas-ashes/</guid></item><item><title>One Writer's Beginnings</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/one-writers-beginnings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/one-writers-beginnings/</guid></item><item><title>From Paycheck to Purpose</title><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a Dave Ramsey kick recently and have heard Ken Coleman co-host on The Ramsey Show several times, so I thought I would give this book a shot—even though I am far from the target audience.
Like the other books from Ramsey Solutions that I&amp;rsquo;ve read, the writing quality is poor and could be consolidated to a couple of articles.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t like that most supporting arguments came from anecdotal evidence.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/from-paycheck-to-purpose/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/from-paycheck-to-purpose/</guid></item><item><title>Die With Zero</title><description>&lt;p>I read this book just after being introduced to &lt;a href="https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s 7 Baby Steps&lt;/a>, which for their obvious flaws, have helped many people climb out of debt.
&lt;em>Die With Zero&lt;/em> is written for people who already know that they should live below their means and save for retirement—an audience that does not overlap with Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s.
Bill Perkins writes to people who are likely to &lt;em>oversave&lt;/em> for retirement, and asks readers to consider a different way of looking at money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of maximizing your life for the largest retirement savings account, Perkins suggests living a life where &lt;em>life enjoyment&lt;/em> is optimized.
He doesn&amp;rsquo;t suggest spending lavishly, but he does put an emphasis on using your money intentionally.
Money is only useful for what it can buy and because it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to delay present enjoyment for a greater reward later, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to miss out on enjoyment in the process.
Money is only worth what it can buy you.
It&amp;rsquo;s worthless on its own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>Die With Zero&lt;/em> mindset considers investment in human capital and unquantifiable returns in addition to typical investments.
A trip to Europe is a great example.
Timing is critical.
You could do this trip while in your 20&amp;rsquo;s with little savings, or wait until your 30&amp;rsquo;s when you have a little more in the bank.
Sure, saving aggressively when you&amp;rsquo;re young is important.
Compound interest rewards you well.
But waiting too long to take the trip to Europe, might leave you feeling too old to stay in a hostel or you could now have kids that make taking a month-long trip away from them feel foolish.
And this doesn&amp;rsquo;t even consider the impact of a changed worldview from the trip.
You can&amp;rsquo;t put a number that.
Moreover, who&amp;rsquo;s to say you&amp;rsquo;ll even benefit from the difference in savings by delaying the trip.
You might be unable to use the money you saved so diligently because you are physically incapable of doing some of the things you always dreamed of doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book helped me reevaluate the way I look at spending and saving.
Dying with no money in the bank is an impossible task because no one knows when they will die, but Perkins says you can try to get close.
Dying with no money in the bank seems selfish at first because it sounds like you are leaving no inheritance and give nothing to charity.
Perkins just means that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to die with money in the bank that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a purpose.
He intentionally sets aside money to be donated and for his kids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perkins also wants to give most of his kids&amp;rsquo; inheritance to them while he is alive.
He could put an amount aside now and let compound interest do its magic, but the longer he waits to give his kids their inheritance, the less utility of the money.
Less money given to a 25-year-old can have a much bigger impact than more given to a 50-year-old.
Most people already own a home at age 50 and they probably already have everything they need, but at age 25, someone might be looking to put a downpayment on a house for the first time.
Perkins wants to use his inheritance where the value of the money given is greater than its face value, like in this situation.
Receiving money would greatly accelerate the process of saving for a downpayment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, trying to die with no money in the bank when I die is far too extreme for me, but the thought experiments in this book have changed the way I see money forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I fully recommend this book.
Please read it.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/die-with-zero/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 00:00:00

because David Hilfiker gives insight into the creation of my dad&amp;rsquo;s place of work.
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of weird reading a book after you already know some of the people in it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hilfiker is a great example of what it looks like to commit your life to service.
He noticed a lack of resources for individuals experiencing home insecurity who were too sick to stay in a homeless shelter, but weren&amp;rsquo;t so sick they needed to be in a hospital and created facilities to fill this gap.
Years later, my dad works for Unity Health Care, created out of Health Care for the Homeless Project, which Hilfiker helped start.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/not-all-of-us-are-saints/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/not-all-of-us-are-saints/</guid></item><item><title>Subliminal</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/subliminal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/subliminal/</guid></item><item><title>The Innovators</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-innovators/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-innovators/</guid></item><item><title>The Prodigal God</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-prodigal-god/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-prodigal-god/</guid></item><item><title>Bible</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/bible/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/bible/</guid></item><item><title>Linchpin</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/linchpin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/linchpin/</guid></item><item><title>Dare to Lead</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/</guid></item><item><title>How to Be an Antiracist</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/how-to-be-an-antiracist/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/how-to-be-an-antiracist/</guid></item><item><title>The Power of Habit</title><description>&lt;p>I think everyone should read one habit book.
&lt;em>The Power of Habit&lt;/em> makes the case that most of our decisions are made by habits—subconsciously, which reminded me of &lt;a href="https://buchh.org/reading/subliminal">&lt;em>Subliminal&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.
Since reading it, I&amp;rsquo;ve made an effort to be more cognizant of some of my habits and have made new ones too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://buchh.org/reading/atomic-habits">&lt;em>Atomic Habits&lt;/em>&lt;/a> shares many of the same insights with Duhigg&amp;rsquo;s book, so it might not be worth reading both. I will note that &lt;em>The Power of Habit&lt;/em> was released first, but they&amp;rsquo;re both good.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-power-of-habit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-power-of-habit/</guid></item><item><title>Between the World and Me</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/between-the-world-and-me/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/between-the-world-and-me/</guid></item><item><title>Born a Crime</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/born-a-crime/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/born-a-crime/</guid></item><item><title>Becoming</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/becoming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/becoming/</guid></item><item><title>Caste</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/caste/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/caste/</guid></item><item><title>White Fragility</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/white-fragility/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/white-fragility/</guid></item><item><title>The Third Door</title><description>&lt;p>This book didn&amp;rsquo;t really present any unique insights.
It was centered around the story of Banayan getting past cold emails with some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most influential people—an extremely shallow goal.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-third-door/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-third-door/</guid></item><item><title>How to Win Friends and Influence People</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/</guid></item><item><title>Factfulness</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/factfulness/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/factfulness/</guid></item><item><title>The 4-Hour Workweek</title><description>&lt;p>I think this book was revolutionary for its time, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it.
Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because it was dated when I read it.
Regardless, I see work differently than Ferriss.
I want to work a job from which I never want to retire because I believe in its mission.
It also seems myopic to not save for retirement and hope your low-effort money making scheme continues to make ends meet.
In the twelve short years from its release to when I read it, I&amp;rsquo;m not positive that Ferriss&amp;rsquo;s business was still profitable/existed.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-4-hour-workweek/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-4-hour-workweek/</guid></item><item><title>The Tools of Titans</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-tools-of-titans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-tools-of-titans/</guid></item><item><title>Just Mercy</title><description>&lt;p>This book was one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read and the movie doesn&amp;rsquo;t compare.
When I first read &lt;em>Just Mercy&lt;/em>, I was in middle school.
I can remember feeling so angry at the injustice of people using false testimony to put innocent people on death row.
I thought it was so cool that Bryan Stevenson was his law degree to fight to get wrongly convicted individuals off of death row—pro bono.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/just-mercy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/just-mercy/</guid></item><item><title>Mountains Beyond Mountains</title><description>&lt;p>This book does a great job not only describing Paul Farmer&amp;rsquo;s tenacity to take care of his patients in Haiti, but also how he dealt with the dilemma of prioritizing helping save people&amp;rsquo;s lives over spending time with his family.
In a sense, he saw every moment that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t helping someone in a critical condition to be wasted.
My dad was inspired by Farmer, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad he&amp;rsquo;s been able to balance seeing patients and making time for family.&lt;/p></description><link>https://buchh.org/reading/mountains-beyond-mountains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/mountains-beyond-mountains/</guid></item><item><title>Shoe Dog</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/shoe-dog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/shoe-dog/</guid></item><item><title>The Language of God</title><description/><link>https://buchh.org/reading/the-language-of-god/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://buchh.org/reading/the-language-of-god/</guid></item></channel></rss>
