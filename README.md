My [personal website](https://buchh.org) published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Why [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)?

There are a few things considerations that led me to choose Hugo:
- Simplicity
- Ability to make posts using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- Ability to use templates (to allow for consistent headings and footers on all pages)
- Not being annoying to install (like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com))

## Development

`make serve`

## Resume

1. Install LaTeX on MacOS: `brew install mactex`
2. Compile: `make`
