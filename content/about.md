My name is Jonathan Buchholz and I'm a junior at Middlebury College studying International Politics & Economics. I'm on a quest to understand the world a little more fully with each passing day, so if you have a lead on something you think I might find interesting (books, articles, websites, movies, etc.), drop me a line at [interesting@buchh.org](mailto:interesting@buchh.org)!
</div>

Here are some of my affections:

- [Strava](https://www.strava.com)
    - Social media that makes my life better, not worse.
- [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/)
    - News how it should be.
- [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)
    - Analysis on social issues that displays data better than I have seen anywhere else.

## Why does this site look so boring?

Simplicity and speed considerations dictated the construction of **buchh.org**. If you're interested, you can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/JonathanBuchh/buchh.org).
