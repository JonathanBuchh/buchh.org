description: About Jonathan Buchholz.
---
My name is Jonathan Buchholz and I'm a sophomore at Middlebury College studying International Politics & Economics. I'm on a quest to understand the world a little more fully with each passing day, so if you have a lead on something you think I might find interesting (books, articles, websites, movies, etc.), drop me a line at [interesting@buchh.org](mailto:interesting@buchh.org)!

I'm also currently looking for summer 2025 management consulting opportunities. [Connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanbuchh/)?

Here are some of my affections:

- [The Deep Life](https://www.thedeeplife.com)
    - Cal Newport reminds me to live and work more deeply and gives practical examples on how implement his advice. I recommend reading his books — they're a refreshing take on "productivity."
- [The Economist](https://www.economist.com)
    - Thank you, Middlebury College, for giving us access to The Economist. "The world in brief" blows Wikipedia's [current events portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events) out of the water
- [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool)
    - It seems that every time I visit **pudding.cool**, there's an incredible new interactive web-based story with data that inspires me to be more creative. It's hard to explain what they do — maybe [check out the site](https://pudding.cool)?!
- [Strava](https://www.strava.com/features)
    - Social media that makes my life better, not worse, pushing me to become a better endurance athlete

## Why does this site look so boring?

Simplicity and speed considerations dictated the construction of **buchh.org**. If you're interested, you can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/JonathanBuchh/buchh.org).
