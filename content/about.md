Hi, I'm Jonathan Buchholz, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science
and Technology.

## Why does this site look so boring?

Simplicity and speed considerations dictated the design of this site.
Plus, I like the brutalist look ;)

## Colophon

This website uses [Hugo] as a static site generator and is hosted by [GitHub
pages] for free.
I have a more detailed description of my setup on my website's
[`README.md`].

## Disclaimer

My opinions change over time, so something on this site may not represent my
current views.
Additionally, I am not a subject matter expert in any subject, so
take everything with a grain of salt.
