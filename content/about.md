My name is Jonathan Buchholz and I'm a first-year student at Middlebury College on a quest to understand the world (ambitious, I know!). If you have a lead on something you think I might find interesting (books, articles, websites, movies, etc.), drop me a line at [interesting@buchh.org](mailto:interesting@buchh.org)!

Here are some of my affections:

- [The Deep Life](https://www.thedeeplife.com)
    - Cal Newport reminds me to live and work more deeply and gives practical examples on how implement his advice. I recommend reading his books — they're a refreshing take on "productivity."
- [The Economist](https://www.economist.com)
    - Thank you, Middlebury, for giving us access to The Economist. "The world in brief" is exactly what I had been looking for: the most essential developments in current events, written with as much brevity as possible. It blows Wikipedia's [current events portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events) out of the water.
- [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool)
    - It seems that every time I visit **pudding.cool**, there's an incredible new interactive web-based story with data that inspires me to be more creative. It's hard to explain what they do — maybe [check out the site](https://pudding.cool)?!

## Why does this site look so boring?

Simplicity and speed considerations dictated the construction of **buchh.org**. If you're interested, you can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/JonathanBuchh/buchh.org).
