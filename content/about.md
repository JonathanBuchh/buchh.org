My name is Jonathan Buchholz and I am a first-year student at Middlebury College. I like keeping this website alive because it motivates me to read.

Send me something interesting (books, articles, websites) at [interesting@buchh.org](mailto:interesting@buchh.org)!

## Websites I Find Interesting

- [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex)
- [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/podcast)
- [The Center for Preventative Action's Global Conflict Tracker](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker)
- [The Deep Life with Cal Newport](https://www.thedeeplife.com)
- [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool)

## Why does this site look so boring?

Simplicity and speed considerations dictated the design of this site.
Plus, I like the brutalist look ;)
