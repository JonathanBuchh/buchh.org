Hi, I'm Jonathan Buchholz, a freshman at Middlebury College.

## Why does this site look so boring?

Simplicity and speed considerations dictated the design of this site.
Plus, I like the brutalist look ;)

## Colophon

This website uses [Hugo] as a static site generator and is hosted by [GitHub
pages] for free.
I have a more detailed description of my setup on my website's
[`README.md`].
