My name is Jonathan Buchholz and I'm a sophomore at Middlebury College studying International Politics & Economics. I'm on a quest to understand the world a little more fully with each passing day, so if you have a lead on something you think I might find interesting (books, articles, websites, movies, etc.), drop me a line at [interesting@buchh.org](mailto:interesting@buchh.org)!

Here are some of my affections:

- [The Deep Life](https://www.thedeeplife.com)
    - Cal Newport reminds me to live and work more deeply and gives practical examples on how implement his advice. I recommend reading his books — they're a refreshing take on "productivity."
- [The Economist](https://www.economist.com)
    - Thank you, Middlebury College, for giving us access to The Economist. "The world in brief" blows Wikipedia's [current events portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events) out of the water. [Espresso](https://www.economist.com/news/2024/09/03/espresso-our-daily-news-app-is-now-free-for-students) (which includes "The world in brief") is free for students!
- [Strava](https://www.strava.com/features)
    - Social media that makes my life better, not worse, and pushes me to become a better endurance athlete

## Why does this site look so boring?

Simplicity and speed considerations dictated the construction of **buchh.org**. If you're interested, you can take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/JonathanBuchh/buchh.org).
