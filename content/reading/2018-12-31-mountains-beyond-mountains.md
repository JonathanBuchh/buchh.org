This book does a great job not only describing Paul Farmer's tenacity to take care of his patients in Haiti, but also how he dealt with the dilemma of prioritizing helping save people's lives over spending time with his family.
In a sense, he saw every moment that he wasn't helping someone in a critical condition to be wasted.
My dad was inspired by Farmer, but I'm glad he's been able to balance seeing patients and making time for family.
