I'm not one that normally reads science fiction, but I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book on audio. _The New York Times Magazine_'s [article] on Ken Liu's translation is fascinating. This book, along with CGP Grey's [rock paper scissors video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWQmZXYd74)[^1] has me thinking about the future of humanity.
