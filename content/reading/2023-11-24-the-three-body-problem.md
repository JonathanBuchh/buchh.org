I'm not one that normally reads science fiction, but I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this book on audio. _The New York Times Magazine_'s [article] on Ken Liu's translation is fascinating and this book, along with CGP Grey's [rock paper scissors video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWQmZXYd74)[^1], has me thinking about the future of humanity. It remains to be seen if I will read the rest of the trilogy—_The Three Body Problem_ didn't land on a cliffhanger that is compelling me to find out more; I am satisfied with the ending.
