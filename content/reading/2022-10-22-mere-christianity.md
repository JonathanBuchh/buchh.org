I'll be honest.
I had higher expectations for this book.
It could be that I was already familiar with many of the arguments _Mere Christianity_ introduces (likely from people who read this book themselves) or that I didn't approach reading it with historical significance in mind.
I imagine that I might revisit this book at later dateâ€”when I can appreciate it better.
It was difficult for me to get past Lewis' personal opinion in some sections and appreciate the larger picture of the arguments he made.
