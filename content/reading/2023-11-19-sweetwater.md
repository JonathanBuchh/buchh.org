When Jason Heaton[^1] writes a book, I read it. I haven't been able to put down _Sweetwater_ or its predecessor, _[Depth Charge]_. Heaton is [unashamedly inspired] by Ian Fleming and thus, his protagonist shares many tropes with James Bond, whether you like them or not. A modern day Fleming, Heaton makes a conscious effort to contemporize his book and adresses themes like mental health, eating disorders, and gender and minorities representation.

Although Heaton may have initially intended to publish this book through the traditional method, unlike with _Depth Charge_, he ended up self-publishing. While I don't know the circumstances, I do know that this book was edited by a literary agent and the Kindle edition is only $2.99!
