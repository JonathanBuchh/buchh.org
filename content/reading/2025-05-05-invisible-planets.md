I am so grateful to have gotten to take Literature of the People's Republic of China with Professor Thomas Moran in his final semester of teaching. He encouraged us to think for ourselves and write for our classmates, which helped me develop more original ideas and arguments. The lack of grades on formal assignments gave me the freedom to experiment in my writing and helped me feel less pressure. Professor Moran has a gift for facilitating discussions and is just an overall cool guy. I loved reading pretty much all of the required books and Literature of the PRC was definitely one of my favorite courses in college thus far.
