I am a big fan of Cal Newport and his style of "smart productivity" that blends traditional self-help with regular non-fiction writing. I'm a regular listener of Newport's [Deep Questions Podcast] where I heard about pretty much everything in the book, but it was still worth reading through this text because it nicely lays out the entire idea of "Slow Productivity" in a cohesive package.
