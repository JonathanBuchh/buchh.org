I think everyone should read one habit book.
_The Power of Habit_ makes the case that most of our decisions are made by habitsâ€”subconsciously, which reminded me of [_Subliminal_](/reading/subliminal).
Since reading it, I've made an effort to be more cognizant of some of my habits and have made new ones too.

[_Atomic Habits_](/reading/atomic-habits) shares many of the same insights with Duhigg's book, so it might not be worth reading both. I will note that _The Power of Habit_ was released first, but they're both good.
