I think this book was revolutionary for its time, but I didn't really like it.
Maybe it's because it was dated when I read it.
Regardless, I see work differently than Ferriss.
I want to work a job from which I never want to retire because I believe in its mission.
It also seems myopic to not save for retirement and hope your low-effort money making scheme continues to make ends meet.
In the twelve short years from its release to when I read it, I'm not positive that Ferriss's business was still profitable/existed.
