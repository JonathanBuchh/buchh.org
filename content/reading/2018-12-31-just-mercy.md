This book was one of the best I've ever read and the movie doesn't compare.
When I first read _Just Mercy_, I was in middle school.
I can remember feeling so angry at the injustice of people using false testimony to put innocent people on death row.
I thought it was so cool that Bryan Stevenson was his law degree to fight to get wrongly convicted individuals off of death rowâ€”pro bono.
