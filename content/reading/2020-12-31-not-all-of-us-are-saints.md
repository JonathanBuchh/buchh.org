This was particularly interesting to read because David Hilfiker gives insight into the creation of my dad's place of work.
It's kind of weird reading a book after you already know some of the people in it!

Hilfiker is a great example of what it looks like to commit your life to service.
He noticed a lack of resources for individuals experiencing home insecurity who were too sick to stay in a homeless shelter, but weren't so sick they needed to be in a hospital and created facilities to fill this gap.
Years later, my dad works for Unity Health Care, created out of Health Care for the Homeless Project, which Hilfiker helped start.
