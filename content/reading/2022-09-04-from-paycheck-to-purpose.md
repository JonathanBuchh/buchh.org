I've been on a Dave Ramsey kick recently and have heard Ken Coleman co-host on The Ramsey Show several times, so I thought I would give this book a shotâ€”even though I am far from the target audience.
Like the other books from Ramsey Solutions that I've read, the writing quality is poor and could be consolidated to a couple of articles.
I didn't like that most supporting arguments came from anecdotal evidence.
