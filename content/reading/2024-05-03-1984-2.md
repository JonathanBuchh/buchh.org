I am really glad that I revisited _1984_ [after a few years](/reading/1984). The first time I read it, I was mainly concerned with the theme of mass surveillance, but recently, authoritarian regimes have been on my mind (hopefully, I'll take a class on them this fall), so the book read differently than the first time. _1984_ is a classic for a reason and I should really purchase a physical copy at some point.
